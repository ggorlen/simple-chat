# simple-chat

This is a super basic chat app with socket.io, running on [Render](https://simple-chat-nvo8.onrender.com/).

I've used it as a backend for student projects. See these codepen front-ends, which students would code up against the backend:

- [full-featured chat](https://codepen.io/ggorlen/pen/qBWwrZW)
- [simple chat](https://codepen.io/ggorlen/pen/BaBXEmN)
